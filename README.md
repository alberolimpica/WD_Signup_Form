# WD_Signup_Form

This is one of the projects of Angela Yu's 201 Web Development Bootcamp.

This is a webpage that has been developed to work with node.js, express and API's. A Signup form has been developed using bootstrap, this will take the name, last name and email of the user and will sign it up to a fictional newsletter (the user won't receive an actual newsletter) using Mailchip's API. Using Mailchip's dashboard we'll be able to see how many people have been suscribed.
